# Battery Life Cycle Measurement

This project includes implementations of battery life cycle measurement in Python and Java. Both implementations provide a class [`Battery`](battery_life.py) (in Python) and [`BatteryLife`](BatteryLife.java) (in Java) with methods to discharge, charge, and get the percentage of remaining battery life.

## Python Implementation (battery_life.py)

- **File Extension:** `.py`
- **Usage:**
  1. Run the [script](battery_life.py) using Python.
  2. Enter the initial capacity and maximum capacity of the battery when prompted.
  3. The script will output the percentage of remaining battery life.

## Java Implementation (BatteryLife.java)

- **File Extension:** `.java`
- **Usage:**
  1. Compile the [Java file](BatteryLife.java) using a Java compiler (`javac BatteryLife.java`).
  2. Run the compiled class file (`java BatteryLife`).
  3. Enter the initial capacity and maximum capacity of the battery when prompted.
  4. The program will output the percentage of remaining battery life.
